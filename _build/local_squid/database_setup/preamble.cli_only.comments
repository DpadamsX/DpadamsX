-- See PgSource_Build to regenerate this script.-- Pre-flight:-- Delete the database by hand, if it exists.-- Note: We may be able to skip this step in PG 13 because of the new WITH (FORCE) argument on DROP DATABASE.-- Post-run:-- After running all of the code here, check the custom psql log created during the run.-- It's named databse_name_database_setup_psql_run.log, like squid_database_setup_psql_run.-- Look for:-- "Error:", where it's not part of a canned test case response record.-- "Fatal:"-- "No such"-- If everything is okay, set up and run the unit tests, run the squid_setup_tests.sql file in Terminal-- and follow the testing instructions at the top of that file.-- This isn't quite ready for RDS as search path and grants are only grabbing the local versions.-- But I couldn't get psql working through SSH anyway.
