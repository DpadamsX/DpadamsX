Not sure what it means, for for function operations, there are different firings:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/event-trigger-matrix.html				ddl_command_start	ddl_command_end		sql_dropALTER FUNCTION	X					XCREATE FUNCTION	X					XDROP FUNCTION	X					X					XCREATE EVENT TRIGGERhttps://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createeventtrigger.htmlCan filter by TAG, but I haven't seen an example of how that works. Maybe the same as command_tag used here:https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-event-triggers.htmlOr maybe it's TG_TAG?Ah, found an example:https://blog.dbi-services.com/can-i-do-it-with-postgresql-16-ddl-triggers/CREATE EVENT TRIGGER no_ddl_allowed  ON ddl_command_end WHEN TAG IN ('ALTER TABLE')  EXECUTE PROCEDURE no_ddl();
